# Backpropagating-Bananas

Implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms using Python and NumPy.

## About This Project

This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms built from the ground up. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of these algorithms by coding them without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines

## Technical Details

- All implementations are in Python, primarily using NumPy for numerical operations.
- The code aims to be production-ready, including proper error handling and edge case management.
- Each algorithm is implemented as a Python class, allowing for easy use and integration.

## Project Structure

Each algorithm has its own directory containing:
- The main implementation file
- A test file with unit tests
- Example usage scripts
- Documentation explaining the algorithm and implementation details

## Learning Resources

This project is meant to be educational. Each implementation includes detailed comments and accompanying documentation to explain the algorithms and their implementation details.
