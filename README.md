# Backpropagating Bananas 🍌

Going absolute bananas implementing popular machine learning algorithms, from scratch.

## About This Bunch 🍇

This repository is a fruity adventure through the world of machine learning algorithms. We're peeling back the layers and implementing everything from the ground up, no pre-made smoothies here!

### On the Menu 🥝

- Gradient Descent ("The Banana origins")
- Linear Regression (aka "The Straight Banana")
- Logistic Regression ("The Curved Banana")
- Neural Networks ("The Banana Brain")
- Decision Trees ("The Fruit Salad Maker")
- Random Forests ("The Banana Grove")
- Support Vector Machines ("The Banana Slicer")

### Our Secret Sauce 🍎

All implementations are in Python, because snakes and fruits go surprisingly well together!

## Warning: Berry Jokes Ahead 🍓

Be prepared for an avalanche of fruit puns and berry bad jokes in the comments. We find them appealing, but your mileage may vary.

## Contribute 🍊

Feel free to cherry-pick an algorithm and submit a pull request. Let's make this fruit basket overflow with knowledge!

Remember: In this repo, we don't just eat bananas. We code them, debug them, and occasionally slip on them. Happy coding! 🍌💻

## Credits Where It's Due 🏆

To Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This fruit theme sprang out from a fun conversation with the AI, whilst mindlessly wandering through existential crisis.
